  The EthereumJS Client is an Ethereum Execution Client (similar to go-ethereum or Nethermind) written in TypeScript/JavaScript, the non-Smart-Contract language Ethereum dApp developers are most familiar with. It is targeted to be a client for research and development and not meant to be used in production on mainnet for the foreseeable future (out of resource and security considerations).

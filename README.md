A set of [Helm](https://helm.sh/) charts to run multiple components of the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) blockchain on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.  Please refer to
Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) to get started.

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:

```sh
helm repo add ethereum-helm-charts https://ethpandaops.github.io/ethereum-helm-charts
```

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve
the latest versions of the packages.  You can then run the following command to see the charts.

```sh
helm search repo ethereum-helm-charts
```

To install the ethstats chart:

```sh
helm install ethstats ethereum-helm-charts/ethstats
```

To uninstall the chart:

```sh
helm delete ethstats
```
